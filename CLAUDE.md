# AI Use Case Presentation Examples

These are demonstration examples for the UCSD AI Use Case presentation.

The examples showcase Claude Code extensibility features:
- **Skills** (`.claude/skills/`) - Auto-discoverable, can be user or model invoked
- **Commands** (`.claude/commands/`) - User-invoked slash commands
- **MCP Servers** - External tools and prompts via Model Context Protocol

All examples intentionally implement the same weather functionality to demonstrate how the same capability can be exposed through different extension mechanisms. This is for testing and comparison purposes.
